# plan-check Requirements Specification

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** plan-check (BBL Prüfplattform Flächenmanagement)

**Purpose:** Replace/modernize the existing BBL floor plan validation platform with an open-source solution that validates DWG/DXF files against BBL CAD-Richtlinie standards and SIA 416 area calculation specifications before CAFM import.

**Target Users:**
- BBL internal staff (Flächenmanagement team)
- External planners/architects submitting floor plans
- Project managers reviewing submissions

**Current Status:** Frontend prototype complete (production-ready UI), backend planned for Phase 1

## Open Questions

1. **Authentication:** Will prototype use simple auth or mock eIAM integration?
2. **DWG Processing:** Speckle cloud or self-hosted LibreDWG?
3. **Data Persistence:** How long to retain uploaded files and results?
4. **Integration:** Any existing systems to integrate with (SAP RE-FX, SUPERB)?
5. **Validation Rules:** Are the 14 layers in CAD-Richtlinie complete, or are there additional rules?
6. **SIA 416 Logic:** How are area types (HNF, NNF, VF, FF) determined from room codes?
7. **Multi-tenancy:** Should external planners see only their own projects?
